**Title:** [International Recruitment Interactive Dashboard](https://github.com/cjlferguson/cjlferguson.github.io/blob/main/TalentRecruitProject.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Conditional Formatting, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Filters, Sort, Slicers)

**Project Description:** The study analyses and provides the key metrics in the recruitment process for an International Recruitment Agency. It identifies trends and patterns in the recruitment process across different global regions for the months of March and April, 2022. 
The study focusses on three geographical areas of recruitment resource: North America, Europe, and Asia. The data set holds over seven thousand (7000) rows of data with information spread over three tables. 
The recruitment process has seven (7) active phases: Application Review, Phone Screening, Interview #1, Waitlist, Next Steps, Final Interview, Diligence. These phases are separated and analyzed through various Excel tools and curated via a Dashboard.
The dashboard includes the following:
1.	Global Talent Count Per Month. Visual representation of count number of applicants during each phase of the recruitment process.
2.	Recruiters by Region. Demonstrates the performance by numbers of recruiters for each region they are responsible for.
3.	Talent Count by Region. Highlights by numbers within the recruitment process the talent resource each region provides. 
4.	Recruiter Performance by Month. Provides the top 11 recruiters presenting their recruitment performance by percentage. 
Additionally, the dashboard includes several slicers for:
Month. To filter data for a specific month.
Region. Focus on regional areas regarding their place as a global talent resource for recruitment purposes.
Stage Name. To drill down into the performance of recruiters across regions and the performance of talent recruitment within each phase of the recruitment process.



**Key findings:** 
1.	The agency recruits talent from across three regions: North America (74%), Europe (18%), and Asia (8%). For the combined months of March and April this represented 3440 applications. 
2.	Average daily applications = 70. 
3.	No. of recruiters at agency = 56. The top 11 provides agency with over 70% of talent recruitment. This represents 19% of the agency that brings in 70% of talent recruitment over the combined period of March and April with only 80% contributing to the remaining 30% of applications.
4.	Talent recruitment for March was 1985 while for April 1455, a decrease by 27% from the previous month. 
5.	March 3-6 recorded the highest application intake for both months: March 6 at 346 applications, 334 on March 5, 121 on March 3, and 100 on March 4. Applications averaged 64 per day for the entire month when considered with this four day window of high intake. Excluding for March 3-6 average daily applications were reduced to 43 per day. For the month of April applications averaged at 49 per day.
6.	Commercial & Contract Law, Litigation, Investigations & Dispute Resolution, and Legal Support were overall the 3 major areas for talent recruitment. Further focus should be given to strengthening Bankruptcy & Reorganization, Corporate, Mergers and Acquisitions, Intellectual Property, Labor & Employment, Tax, and Finance. These were areas where regions were very strong at and could provide significant resource to recruitment from those talent fields.
7.	Recruiter numbers should be reduced by 66% which represents the number of recruiters who brought in 1% or less over the combined months of March and April.
8.	Members of the Top 11 recruiters should be better distributed. It was found that many of the top recruiters were in one team. The human resource could be better managed by distributing members equally among regional teams which would improve agency efficiency and goals in the various regions of talent acquisitions. 

**Drill Down:**

Analysis of Recruiters


1.	There are 56 recruiters working at the agency. Of the 56, 11 provides the agency with its entire application listing, a total of 2533 applications for both the months of March and April. These have contributed to the listing with a performance of no lower than 5%. Of the 11 recruiters, 16% of the recruitment belonged to Recruiter 1, 15% by Recruiter 10, 14% by Recruiter 2, and 10% is made by Recruiter 11 for the month of March. Collectively, these 4 recruiters account for 55% of recruitments for the months of March.
2.	For the month of April, Recruiter 1’s performance decreased to 13%, Recruiter 10’s was at 9%, Recruiter 2 increased to 16%, Recruiter 11 improved to 15%. 
3.	Other recruiters improved during that month with Recruiter 15 moving from 8% to 11%, and Recruiter 6 improving from 6% to 10%. 
4.	For the month of April, recruiters 1, 2, 11, 15 and 5 brought in 65% of international talent. Despite this, April saw a 27% decline in applications.
5.	However, these may not be considered a true measure of performance as it is the percentage in relation to the grand total of the 11 top recruiters for a specific month. Given that a grand total may change among the 11, if there is reduction in the grand total but improvement in numbers for a particular recruiter, the resulting percentage could be a significant increase. Or if the opposite occurs with a reduction in applications for a particular recruiter but an overall increase in the grand total, the percentage change can be significant. Measurement in this way skews the true performance measure of the individual. However, this measure does give a good idea of the performance of the recruiters over the month. This measure may fit well with group targets and measurements overall, since it is dependent on the performance of the group’s overall performance.
6.	Recruiter’s 15 and 7 may have been due to the reduction of applications within that month. For instance, Recruiter 7’s numeric performance for March and April were 63 and 23 respectively. This is a marked decrease by 40 applications; over half of Recruiter 7’s performance for March was eroded in April. If in March, the numerator is further away from the denominator (the total number of applications for March) compared to April where the numerator is closer to the denominator then from the perspective of percentages Recruiter 7’s performance can easily be seen as an increase. Therefore, the agency’s overall poor performance for April may have masked Recruiter’s 7 and also 15 and therefore may be regarded as not a true performance measure for that month. Nevertheless, as was noted earlier, the percentage measures by month within the grand total of the group still provides a good idea of performance. This measure may fit well with group targets and measurements overall, since it is dependent on the performance of the group’s overall performance.


Regional Analysis


1.	The total talent recruited for March was 1985 applications while for April 1455: a grand total of 3440 talent applications.
2.	Talent is recruited across three global regions with North America significantly providing most of the talent resources at 1460 applicants in March and 1073 for the month of April; Europe coming in second with 333 March applicants compared to its April 289 applicants; and Asia last with 192 compared to 93. 
3.	Combined Months: The three (3) major talent areas for applications provided by the regions were Commercial & Contract Law (30%), Litigation, Investigations & Dispute Resolution (13%), and Legal Support (8%). 
4.	Combined Months: North America led in Commercial & Contract Law at 66%, Europe 25%, and Asia at 9%.  Litigation, Investigations & Dispute Resolution with North America at 83%, Europe at 10%, and Asia at 6%. Legal Support saw North America leading by 76%, Europe 19%, and Asia 5%.

8.	This reduction in talent recruitment was largely contributed by the reduction in North American applications by 387. This was a 27% reduction from North America while Europe and Asia observed a drop by 13% and 51% respectively.
9.	While it was observed that Asia had the highest drop of talent applications by percentage, this region for the two months contributed only 8% to the grand total of talent applications, with Europe providing 18% in recruitment power and the majority recruitment occurring from the North American region for 74% for the two months. 
10.	The agency has retained 37 recruiters for the North American region. Within this group there 8 of the 11 top recruiters are in this group: they are recruiters 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16. These alone accounts for 85% of the entire agency’s recruitment portfolio.

Talent Recruitment Process: Application to 1st Interview to Recruitment


1.	March 3-6 recorded a significant increase in applications with the highest for both months recorded at March 6 at 346 applications, 334 on March 5, 121 on March 3, and 100 on March 4. Applications averaged 64 per day for the entire month when considered with this four day window of high intake. Excluding the March 3-6 window, average applications were reduced to 43 per day. For the month of April applications averaged at 49 per day.
2.	Talent in Commercial & Contract Law was the highest for March and April at 581 (29%) and 463 (32%) respectively. Litigation, Investigations and Dispute Resolution were at 265 (13%) and 193 (13%) for both March and April, and Regulatory & Compliance at 167 (8%) and 93 (6%) for the respective months.
3.	For the month of March only 328 individuals were accepted for the first interview, which was 17% of the original sum of applicants, 1985, and 83% rejection rate for that month. April saw 361 interviews or 25% interviews of the original applicants of 1455, and 75% rejection rate for that month.
4.	At the first interview Commercial & Contract Law remained highest at 122 (37%) and 144 (40%) for March and April respectively. However, Finance was second at 47 (14%) and 35 (10%) respectively, and Legal Support at 47 (14%) and 25 (10%) respectively.
5.	Combined Months: Recruitment: The talent recruitment was highest in these areas: Commercial and Contract Law (39%), Legal Support (15%), Finance (14%).
6.	Combined Months: Recruitment: Asia demonstrated strength in Bankruptcy & Reorganization supplying 50% of talent along with North America, and 50% of talent with North America in Insurance. In both cases Europe’s talent contribution was 0%.

**Recommendations:**
1.	Improving Agency Efficiency. Given that 80% of the agency’s talent recruitment is made by 20% of it’s recruiters, the agency must consider where its human resource strength lies. It is suggested that to increase efficiency at the agency, recruiter numbers should be reduced by 66%. This represents the number of recruiters who brought in 1% or less over the combined months of March and April. This approach would free up further resources which could be invested into strengthening the remaining recruiters with training, access to better tools, and improvement in marketing.
2.	Restructuring and Training. 7 of the Top 11 recruiters were retained in the North American Team. This team should be redistributed along with the remaining 3 members according to application market size over the three regions so that the agency’s strength is better leveraged across the talent recruitment markets. The remaining 8 recruiters should be provided with further training to improve both overall team and specific member capacity to compliment the agency’s goals. Lessons learned and strategies practiced by the top three performing members should be leveraged with the overall knowledge pool of this new group. 
3.	Focus on Key Talent Areas. Commercial & Contract Law, Litigation, Investigations & Dispute Resolution, and Legal Support were overall the 3 major areas for talent recruitment. However the Asian community was competitive in Bankruptcy & Reorganization, Corporate, Mergers and Acquisitions. North America was strongest in Intellectual Property, Labor & Employment, and Tax respectively. Europe showed great strength in Commercial & Contract Law, Mergers & Acquisitions, and Finance. These are areas which could be given future consideration. It may further aid agency goals if recruiters were to specialize in talent recruitment in these areas which may strengthen numbers where market recruitment is low particularly in Asian and some of the European talent areas.
